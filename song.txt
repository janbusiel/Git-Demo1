It's way too late to think of
Someone I would call now
The neon signs got tired
Red eye flights help the stars out
I'm safe in a corner
Just hours before me
I'm waking with the roaches
The world has surrendered
I'm dating ancient ghosts
(The ones I made friends with)
The comfort of fireflies
Long gone before daylight
