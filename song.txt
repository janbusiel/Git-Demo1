It's way too late to think of
Someone I would call now
The neon signs got tired
Red eye flights help the stars out
I'm safe in a corner
Just hours before me
I'm waking with the roaches
The world has surrendered
I'm dating ancient ghosts
(The ones I made friends with)
The comfort of fireflies
Long gone before daylight

So now you know
I've been hiding that I'm sexual
So now you know
I've been hiding that I'm, hiding that I'm-
I'm learning more as I'm dying
I'm more sensitive and more emotional
